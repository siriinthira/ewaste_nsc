# Empathize 
The empathize stage involves understanding the users and their needs in order to create a solution that addresses the challenges they face in managing e-waste. Based on the provided concept, the target users are:

**People who need to dispose of electronic waste (E-Waste):** This includes general consumers who have non-functional electronics or electronics that have reached the end of their useful life. They may not know where to dispose of them or how to do it responsibly.

**Stakeholders in e-waste management:** This includes volunteers, government agencies, and private organizations responsible for the collection, recycling, and disposal of e-waste. These users need tools to track the disposal process and ensure proper handling of waste.

**Key insights from user research:**

**People** need a simple, convenient, and trustworthy way to dispose of e-waste.

**Stakeholders** need efficient tools to monitor and manage the disposal process, as well as ensure transparency and accountability.

**Environmental impact** is a concern for all parties, so the solution should highlight sustainability and health safety.


# Define

**Problem Statement:**
In Thailand, the amount of e-waste is increasing significantly, and people do not have an efficient or convenient way to dispose of their e-waste. Improper disposal leads to environmental degradation, health risks, and reduced quality of life. There is a lack of transparency in the management of e-waste disposal, and citizens are often unaware of where to dispose of their electronic waste.

**Design Goals:**

**Provide convenience:** Users should be able to easily find e-waste disposal points near them and request assistance (volunteers) for pickup.

**Ensure accountability:** Using Blockchain to track and provide transparency regarding the status of e-waste disposal.

**Raise awareness:** Provide users with clear information about the environmental impact and health risks of improper e-waste disposal.

**Increase user engagement:** Create a sense of community involvement in proper e-waste management.

# Ideate

In this phase, we brainstorm and come up with potential design solutions that address the needs and goals established in the define stage.

**Key Features to Implement:**

**User Profiles & Authentication:**

**End users (consumers):** Simple login with social media or email, enabling easy access to disposal services.

**Admin/Volunteers:** More detailed profiles to manage collection points and track e-waste disposal.

**E-Waste Collection Points Map:**

A map interface where users can search and locate the nearest e-waste disposal points.

Filters for types of e-waste accepted, availability of volunteers, and hours of operation.

**Request Pickup Feature:**

A button for users to request a volunteer to pick up their e-waste directly from their location.

A real-time tracking system that shows the volunteerâ€™s estimated time of arrival.

E-Waste Tracking & Transparency (Blockchain Integration):

A Blockchain ledger that records every step of the e-waste disposal process for transparency.

Users can check the disposal history for accountability (who is responsible, where and when the waste was disposed of, and its final destination).

**Notifications & Reminders:**

Push notifications to remind users about upcoming scheduled pickups, local disposal points, or new information about e-waste disposal.

Feedback loops where users can rate their experience and report issues with e-waste management.

**Educational Section:**

Information on the dangers of improper disposal and how proper e-waste management can contribute to a healthier environment.

Tutorial videos on how to correctly prepare e-waste for disposal (e.g., removing batteries).

**Sustainability & Community Engagement:**

A rewards system that incentivizes users for properly disposing of e-waste or participating in community programs (e.g., points for each e-waste disposal that can be redeemed for rewards).

A community forum where users can share tips, post local e-waste disposal events, and discuss environmental sustainability.
