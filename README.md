# e-Waste
Build a Prototype of an e-Waste Management System

🚀 **Project Goals**

The goal of the E-Waste Management App is to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and secure platform for individuals to dispose of electronic waste responsibly. The app aims to:

Streamline e-waste disposal through easy-to-use features for logging items and choosing between pickup or drop-off methods.

Enhance community involvement by offering volunteer collectors incentives and rewards for their participation.

Ensure proper handling of sensitive data by securely wiping or destroying personal information on devices before recycling.

Promote environmental sustainability by facilitating the proper recycling of e-waste through certified recycling centers and material recovery.

Educate and engage users by providing an intuitive, gamified experience, encouraging more responsible e-waste disposal and rewarding eco-friendly behavior.

# ♻️ How the E-Waste Management App Works

**1. User Profile Setup**

Users register with their name, contact details, and default address.

This info helps in tracking pickups, item history, and communication.

**2. Add E-Waste Items**

Users log items they want to dispose of, providing:

Serial No. (for tracking)

Item Genre (e.g., mobile phone, monitor, battery)

Weight

Size

Quantity or Estimated Value

Photo of the Item

**3. View Submitted Items**

Users can review, edit, or delete previously added items.

Each item shows its current status (pending, scheduled, completed, etc.).

**4. Choose Disposal Method**

**a) Request a Collector Pickup**

When the user requests a pickup:

They select a pickup location on the map (can be different from their profile address).

A volunteer collector is notified, accepts the request, and proceeds to the designated location.

The items are picked up and delivered to the Collection & Sorting Center .

**✅ Collector Incentive System**

Volunteer collectors receive points for each pickup they complete.

Points may depend on factors like:

Type and weight of e-waste

Distance traveled

Number of pickups completed

**🎁 Rewards & Recognition**

How these points are used depends on the company, NGO, or organization running the program.

Points may be redeemed for eco-friendly rewards, gift cards, certificates, or community benefits.

**b) Drop Off at a Nearby Bin**

Users can also drop off items at designated e-waste bins, shown on an interactive map.

These bins are emptied regularly, and items are forwarded to the sorting center.

**5. Sorting & Confidentiality Checks**

At the Sorting Center, items are:

Verified and sorted

Devices with personal or sensitive data undergo secure data wiping or destruction

**6. Recycling Process**

Items are forwarded to certified recycling facilities for:

Disassembly 

Material recovery and reuse

# User Story

**User Story 1: Sudarat Chaiyathavorn (End User - Consumer)**
As a consumer who needs to dispose of old electronics,
I want to easily find nearby e-waste collection points or request a pickup,
so that I can safely and conveniently dispose of my old electronics without contributing to environmental harm.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
The app should have an interactive map showing nearby e-waste collection points.

The user can filter results by the types of e-waste accepted and their operating hours.

A simple, intuitive interface allows users to request a pickup and schedule a time for a volunteer to collect the waste.

Notifications should be sent to users for confirmation, reminders, and status updates on pickup.

The app should provide educational resources on the dangers of improper e-waste disposal.


**User Story 2: Kittiphong Panya (E-Waste Management Worker)**
As an e-waste management worker,
I want to track and manage e-waste pickup requests from users in real-time,
so that I can efficiently collect and dispose of electronic waste, ensuring it is handled responsibly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
The app allows Kittiphong to view requests for pickups from users in real-time and track the status of each request.

Kittiphong can confirm when a pickup has been completed, and the app will automatically update the user.

The app should integrate with a blockchain ledger to track the disposal process and ensure transparency, showing where the e-waste goes after it is collected.

Users should be able to rate the collection process, allowing Kittiphong to gather feedback on the service and improve operations.

Kittiphong can also update the status of local collection points (e.g., hours of operation or changes in accepted waste types).


**User Story 3: Sudarat Chaiyathavorn (End User - Consumer)**
As a consumer who values transparency,
I want to see the status of my e-waste after disposal,
so that I can be assured that my waste was handled properly and ethically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
After a successful disposal or pickup, the app should provide a blockchain-based record showing the status of the e-waste from collection to final disposal.

Sudarat can view details about where her e-waste was sent, whether it was recycled or disposed of responsibly, and the impact on the environment.

Users can access feedback on the e-waste management process, showing transparency and accountability.


**User Story 4: Kittiphong Panya (E-Waste Management Worker)**

As an e-waste management worker,
I want to ensure that the e-waste collected is disposed of according to regulations,
so that I can maintain public trust and comply with environmental regulations.

Acceptance Criteria:
The app should allow Kittiphong to log each collected item, detailing its type and the responsible recycling or disposal method used.

The app will provide guidelines for e-waste disposal, ensuring compliance with local and international environmental laws.

A transparent ledger on the blockchain will record all actions taken during the disposal process for auditability.

Kittiphong should have access to a report showing the types and amounts of e-waste collected to optimize future collection efforts.

# User Journey & Pain Points
