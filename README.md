# e-Waste
Build a Prototype of an e-Waste Management System

üöÄ **Project Goals**

The goal of the E-Waste Management App is to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and secure platform for individuals to dispose of electronic waste responsibly. The app aims to:

Streamline e-waste disposal through easy-to-use features for logging items and choosing between pickup or drop-off methods.

Enhance community involvement by offering volunteer collectors incentives and rewards for their participation.

Ensure proper handling of sensitive data by securely wiping or destroying personal information on devices before recycling.

Promote environmental sustainability by facilitating the proper recycling of e-waste through certified recycling centers and material recovery.

Educate and engage users by providing an intuitive, gamified experience, encouraging more responsible e-waste disposal and rewarding eco-friendly behavior.

# ‚ôªÔ∏è How the E-Waste Management App Works

**1. User Profile Setup**

Users register with their name, contact details, and default address.

This info helps in tracking pickups, item history, and communication.

**2. Add E-Waste Items**

Users log items they want to dispose of, providing:

Serial No. (for tracking)

Item Genre (e.g., mobile phone, monitor, battery)

Weight

Size

Quantity or Estimated Value

Photo of the Item

**3. View Submitted Items**

Users can review, edit, or delete previously added items.

Each item shows its current status (pending, scheduled, completed, etc.).

**4. Choose Disposal Method**

**a) Request a Collector Pickup**

When the user requests a pickup:

They select a pickup location on the map (can be different from their profile address).

A volunteer collector is notified, accepts the request, and proceeds to the designated location.

The items are picked up and delivered to the Collection & Sorting Center .

**‚úÖ Collector Incentive System**

Volunteer collectors receive points for each pickup they complete.

Points may depend on factors like:

Type and weight of e-waste

Distance traveled

Number of pickups completed

**üéÅ Rewards & Recognition**

How these points are used depends on the company, NGO, or organization running the program.

Points may be redeemed for eco-friendly rewards, gift cards, certificates, or community benefits.

**b) Drop Off at a Nearby Bin**

Users can also drop off items at designated e-waste bins, shown on an interactive map.

These bins are emptied regularly, and items are forwarded to the sorting center.

**5. Sorting & Confidentiality Checks**

At the Sorting Center, items are:

Verified and sorted

Devices with personal or sensitive data undergo secure data wiping or destruction

**6. Recycling Process**

Items are forwarded to certified recycling facilities for:

Disassembly 

Material recovery and reuse
