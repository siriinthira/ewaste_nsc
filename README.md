# e-Waste
Build a Prototype of an e-Waste Management System

**Project Goal**

The goal of the E-Waste Management App is to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and secure platform for individuals to dispose of electronic waste responsibly. The app aims to:

Streamline e-waste disposal through easy-to-use features for logging items and choosing between pickup or drop-off methods.

Enhance community involvement by offering volunteer collectors incentives and rewards for their participation.

Ensure proper handling of sensitive data by securely wiping or destroying personal information on devices before recycling.

Promote environmental sustainability by facilitating the proper recycling of e-waste through certified recycling centers and material recovery.

Educate and engage users by providing an intuitive, gamified experience, encouraging more responsible e-waste disposal and rewarding eco-friendly behavior.

# ‚ôªÔ∏è How the E-Waste Management App Works

**1. User Profile Setup**

Users register with their name, contact details, and default address.

This info helps in tracking pickups, item history, and communication.

**2. Add E-Waste Items**

Users log items they want to dispose of, providing:

Serial No. (for tracking)

Item Genre (e.g., mobile phone, monitor, battery)

Weight

Size

Quantity or Estimated Value

Photo of the Item

**3. View Submitted Items**

Users can review, edit, or delete previously added items.

Each item shows its current status (pending, scheduled, completed, etc.).

**4. Choose Disposal Method**

**a) Request a Collector Pickup**

When the user requests a pickup:

They select a pickup location on the map (can be different from their profile address).

A volunteer collector is notified, accepts the request, and proceeds to the designated location.

The items are picked up and delivered to the Collection & Sorting Center .

**‚úÖ Collector Incentive System**

Volunteer collectors receive points for each pickup they complete.

Points may depend on factors like:

Type and weight of e-waste

Distance traveled

Number of pickups completed

**üéÅ Rewards & Recognition**

How these points are used depends on the company, NGO, or organization running the program.

Points may be redeemed for eco-friendly rewards, gift cards, certificates, or community benefits.

**b) Drop Off at a Nearby Bin**

Users can also drop off items at designated e-waste bins, shown on an interactive map.

These bins are emptied regularly, and items are forwarded to the sorting center.

**5. Sorting & Confidentiality Checks**

At the Sorting Center, items are:

Verified and sorted

Devices with personal or sensitive data undergo secure data wiping or destruction

**6. Recycling Process**

Items are forwarded to certified recycling facilities for:

Disassembly 

Material recovery and reuse

# UX UI Design Process

# Empathize 
The empathize stage involves understanding the users and their needs in order to create a solution that addresses the challenges they face in managing e-waste. 

**Target Users:**

**People who need to dispose of electronic waste (E-Waste):** This includes general consumers who have non-functional electronics or electronics that have reached the end of their useful life. They may not know where to dispose of them or how to do it responsibly.

**Stakeholders in e-waste management:** This includes volunteers, government agencies, and private organizations responsible for the collection, recycling, and disposal of e-waste. These users need tools to track the disposal process and ensure proper handling of waste.

**Key insights from user research:**

**People** need a simple, convenient, and trustworthy way to dispose of e-waste.

**Stakeholders** need efficient tools to monitor and manage the disposal process, as well as ensure transparency and accountability.

**Environmental impact** is a concern for all parties, so the solution should highlight sustainability and health safety.

# KPIs

# Define

**Problem Statement:**
In Thailand, the amount of e-waste is increasing significantly, and people do not have an efficient or convenient way to dispose of their e-waste. Improper disposal leads to environmental degradation, health risks, and reduced quality of life. There is a lack of transparency in the management of e-waste disposal, and citizens are often unaware of where to dispose of their electronic waste.

‚ôªÔ∏è **User Needs ‚Äì Summary**
Easy and convenient ways to dispose of e-waste
(via pickup requests or nearby drop-off bins)

Clear instructions on acceptable e-waste items
(item types, preparation steps, etc.)

Real-time tracking and status updates
(from item submission to recycling)

Assurance of secure data handling
(especially for devices with personal information)

Incentives and rewards for participation
(eco-points, certificates, community recognition)

Educational insights about environmental impact
(e.g., how recycling helps reduce pollution)

Simple and user-friendly app experience
(intuitive design, easy navigation)
