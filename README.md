# Empathize 
The empathize stage involves understanding the users and their needs in order to create a solution that addresses the challenges they face in managing e-waste. Based on the provided concept, the target users are:

**People who need to dispose of electronic waste (E-Waste):** This includes general consumers who have non-functional electronics or electronics that have reached the end of their useful life. They may not know where to dispose of them or how to do it responsibly.

**Stakeholders in e-waste management:** This includes volunteers, government agencies, and private organizations responsible for the collection, recycling, and disposal of e-waste. These users need tools to track the disposal process and ensure proper handling of waste.

**Key insights from user research:**

**People** need a simple, convenient, and trustworthy way to dispose of e-waste.

**Stakeholders** need efficient tools to monitor and manage the disposal process, as well as ensure transparency and accountability.

**Environmental impact** is a concern for all parties, so the solution should highlight sustainability and health safety.


# Define

**Problem Statement:**
In Thailand, the amount of e-waste is increasing significantly, and people do not have an efficient or convenient way to dispose of their e-waste. Improper disposal leads to environmental degradation, health risks, and reduced quality of life. There is a lack of transparency in the management of e-waste disposal, and citizens are often unaware of where to dispose of their electronic waste.

**Design Goals:**

**Provide convenience:** Users should be able to easily find e-waste disposal points near them and request assistance (volunteers) for pickup.

**Ensure accountability:** Using Blockchain to track and provide transparency regarding the status of e-waste disposal.

**Raise awareness:** Provide users with clear information about the environmental impact and health risks of improper e-waste disposal.

**Increase user engagement:** Create a sense of community involvement in proper e-waste management.
